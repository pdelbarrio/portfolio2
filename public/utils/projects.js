      "GET OUT BCN is a collaborative database of cool spots in Barcelona. It is divided into different categories. The user has to register to browse or to add spots to the database. The spots are moderated and will not appear until validated by the administrator. Regarding the more technical part one of my purposes with this project was to get into the TypeScript world with React. And although at the beginning it was complicated, as the project progressed I got used to it and it even made some tasks easier if the types were well defined, thus adding an extra layer of security to the application.Another of my purposes was to do testing, and I did TDD with Jest on the backend routes, and I discovered how rewarding the feeling you get when you see all the tests go green ‚úÖ üòè üëåüèª",

The client gave us a complex excel file with a multitude of formulas that related different excel fields according to some inputs. The logic part of the calculator was made using Javascript OOP. The backend was done with django and the frontend (my part) with React, using Hooks and Context to manage the state. The application is in stand by and the repository is private but you can see a small demo if you click the play button.",
